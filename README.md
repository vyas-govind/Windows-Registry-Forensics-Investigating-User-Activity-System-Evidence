## Overview

This project is a hands-on digital forensics investigation focused on offline Windows Registry analysis to reconstruct user and system activity. The objective was to extract persistent artifacts, correlate independent evidence sources, and build a defensible activity timeline.

The investigation demonstrates structured DFIR methodology, artifact interpretation, and professional forensic documentation within a controlled lab environment.

## Objective

* Reconstruct historical user behavior from registry artifacts
* Identify executed programs and file access activity
* Detect removable USB storage usage
* Analyze authentication and login behavior
* Correlate timestamps into a defensible timeline
* Apply structured digital forensic workflow

---

## Tools Used

* Registry Forensics analysis tools
* FTK Imager
* CyberCheck FRAN

---

## Evidence Analyzed

* USBSTOR device history
* Program execution artifacts
* File access traces
* User authentication records (SAM database)
* System configuration interactions
* Registry hive timestamps

---

## Key Findings

* Registry artifacts confirmed attributable user activity including program execution, structured document access, authentication events, and deliberate system navigation
* USBSTOR evidence verified repeated removable storage use, establishing capability for external data transfer
* Timestamp correlation revealed a focused high-engagement activity session within a narrow time window

---

## Skills Demonstrated

* Windows Registry forensic analysis
* Digital evidence interpretation
* Timeline reconstruction
* Artifact correlation
* DFIR workflow application
* Investigative reasoning
* Forensic documentation
